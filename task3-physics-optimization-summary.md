# Task 3: Physics Update Order Optimization - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented the optimization of the physics engine update order in the GameEngine's `updatePhysics()` method to address the space key jump fix requirements.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Optimized Physics Update Sequence

The `updatePhysics()` method has been restructured into 5 distinct stages:

1. **Stage 1: State Preservation** - Store input processing state before physics updates
2. **Stage 2: Force Application** - Apply gravity and friction while preserving ground state continuity
3. **Stage 3: Position Update** - Update entity positions based on velocity
4. **Stage 4: Collision Detection & Resolution** - Enhanced collision detection with validation
5. **Stage 5: Ground State Update** - Update ground state after collision resolution

### 2. Ground State Continuity Improvements

- **Preserved Ground State**: Ground state is now preserved during force application instead of being reset
- **Enhanced Ground Contact Tracking**: `lastGroundContact` timestamp is properly updated when ground contact occurs
- **Collision-Based Ground State**: Ground state is only updated after collision resolution, not before

### 3. Enhanced Logging System

Added comprehensive logging for each physics update stage:

- Pre-update state logging with position, velocity, and ground state
- Stage-by-stage progress logging with detailed information
- Collision processing logs with platform identification
- Ground state change logging with before/after comparison
- Physics update summary with performance metrics

### 4. Collision Resolution Timing

- **Correct Order**: Collision detection now occurs after position updates
- **Ground State Logic**: Ground state is updated after collision resolution
- **Validation**: Added collision validation to ensure realistic ground collisions
- **Boundary Handling**: Enhanced stage boundary collision handling
