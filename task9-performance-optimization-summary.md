  - Memory usage percentage calculation
  - Status classification (good/warning/critical)
  - Browser memory API integration
- **Memory Cleanup**:
  - `performMemoryCleanup()` - Aggressive memory cleanup
  - `cleanupDiagnosticData()` - Clean diagnostic system data
  - Automatic cleanup of metrics arrays when limits exceeded
  - Input event queue cleanup under memory pressure

### 7.4 Resource Cleanup Strengthening ✅

  - Support for intervals, timeouts, event listeners, object pools
  - Centralized resource tracking with Set/Map collections
- **Comprehensive Cleanup**:
  - `cleanupAllResources()` - Clean all registered resources
  - `destroy()` - Complete system destruction with cleanup
  - Automatic cleanup on page unload
  - Resource leak prevention
- **Resource Usage Monitoring**:
  - `getResourceUsage()` - Real-time resource usage statistics
